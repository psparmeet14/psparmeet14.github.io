## Example: Real LinkedIn Post Addition

Let's say you wrote a LinkedIn post about "The Importance of Code Reviews". Here's how to add it:

```html
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
  <div class="card h-100">
    <div class="card-body">
      <div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-3">
        <i class="fas fa-search-plus fa-2x me-3" style="color: #3498db;"></i>
        <h5 class="card-title mb-0">The Art of Code Reviews</h5>
      </div>
      <p class="card-date"><i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i> October 2025</p>
      <p class="card-text">
        Code reviews aren't about finding bugsâ€”they're about <strong>building shared understanding</strong>. 
        The best code reviews I've participated in have been collaborative learning experiences where both 
        reviewer and author walk away with new insights.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        When we review code with curiosity rather than criticism, we create a culture where people are excited 
        to share their work and learn from feedback. The goal isn't perfection; it's continuous improvement 
        and knowledge transfer.
      </p>
      <div class="mt-3">
        <span class="skill-tag">Code Review</span>
        <span class="skill-tag">Collaboration</span>
        <span class="skill-tag">Learning</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
